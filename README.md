# Bringing Sexy to Bee Keeping!
Ever wanted to distinguish between the apiaries you have? Perhaps you felt that the ratio of wood to apiaries was off? Or maybe just that it felt wrong getting some weird yellow box when you definitely used red and blue wood to make it?

If you agree with any of these, then you need ***More Apiaries***!

As an addon to the very popular Forestry mod, this simple mod adds in two new blocks to the game. The *Apiary Builder* and the *Apiary*

*"Wait, just two blocks? You promised me* ***More Apiaries!*** *Just how many will you give me?"*

Patience young beekeeper. Exactly how many Apiaries you get will depend entirely on what other mods you use. How many logs and planks do you have access to?

Now realise that the Apiary Builder will let you make an apiary out of any combination of those, with one per side!  That's a massive number of new apiaries you have access to!

## Or, that's the plan...
I'm just looking for my screwdriver at the moment to work on this, but it will be released soon!
